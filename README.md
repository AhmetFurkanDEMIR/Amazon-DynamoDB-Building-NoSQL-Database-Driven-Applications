Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. It's a fully managed, multi-region, multi-active, durable database with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications. DynamoDB can handle more than 10 trillion requests per day and can support peaks of more than 20 million requests per second.

Many of the world's fastest growing businesses such as Lyft, Airbnb, and Redfin as well as enterprises such as Samsung, Toyota, and Capital One depend on the scale and performance of DynamoDB to support their mission-critical workloads.

Hundreds of thousands of AWS customers have chosen DynamoDB as their key-value and document database for mobile, web, gaming, ad tech, IoT, and other applications that need low-latency data access at any scale. Create a new table for your application and let DynamoDB handle the rest.

* **Course content**

     * Week1 : Information about the course.
     
     * Week2 :  What is DynamoDB?, SQL and NoSQL differences. We created an AWS Cloud9 instance, created a DynamoDB table and filled it with game data.
     
     * Week3 : You used the AWS SDK to continue to build out your application. You used Cloudwatch Metrics and Alarms as well as Cloudwatch Logs. You used AWS x-Ray to detect and dive into performance issues.
     
     * Week4 : You continued to build out your application using a session table and enabling TTL
    You secured your application following the least privilege principle, using AWS IAM, VPC, and an VPC Endpoint for DynamoDB.
    
     * Week5 : We continued building your app using conditional updates and actions and completed the Course !.
